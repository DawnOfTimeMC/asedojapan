# Ancient Structures: Edo Japan v0.1.1
It's been a bit but we are back at it again with our shenanigans. This time adding a few more goodies in and doing a little more work behind the scenes. I've really been enjoying playing more RPG style modpacks and I felt like exploration was a big thing that should influence the project's dynamics. There are some goodies that are in the works to fully flesh out this project. Hopefully more dungeons will come!

New Buildings Added:
* 6 New Statues
* 3 New Shrines

Reworked Buildings:
* The original shrines
* The temple
* Samurai mini fort
* The mini castle

Building Mechanics:
* All buildings had their spawn rates reset to normal values
* Biome generation has been altered. Specific structure sets will now spawn in different biomes than just the original four the pack used
* Some buildings have hidden loot
* Some buildings had their lot changed for balance

If you see any bugs or rebalancing needs, please let me know!
